      Output format is a list of binary-packed time "blocks" so that notes in
      the song can be indexed in O(1) time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each block can be split into a sequence of 8-bit integers. Starting with
      the least-significant bits, these 8-bit numbers represent as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bits 0-7: Starting time of the 1st note within the block. 1 represents
        the start of the block; 255 represents the end of the block. 0 is a
        sentinel value meaning "no note."
      </li>
      <li>
        Bits 8-15: Frequency of the 1st note in semitones, where 60 is middle C.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bits 16-23: Starting time of the 2nd note in the same format as Bits
        0-7.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bits 24-31: Frequency of the 2nd note in semitones in the same format as
        Bits 8-15.
      </li>
      <li>Bits 32-39: Time for the 3rd note.</li>
      <li>Bits 40-47: Freq for the 3rd note.</li>
    </ol>
